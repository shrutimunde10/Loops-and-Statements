# Loops-and-Statements
# THEORY:
Sometimes in programming, it is necessary to repeat an operation (let's say n times) or more than once.
When we need to repeatedly run a set of statements, we utilise loops.
Loop Types:
1.while loop
– First checks the condition, then executes the body.
Syntax:
initialization expression;
while (test_expression)
{
// statements

update_expression;
}
2.for loop
– firstly initializes, then, condition check, execute body, update.
Syntax:
for (initialization expr; test expr; update expr)
{
// body of the loop
// statements we want to execute
}
3.do-while loop
– firstly, execute the body then condition check
Syntax:
initialization expression;
do
{
// statements
update_expression;
} while (test_expression);
